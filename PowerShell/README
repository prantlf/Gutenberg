NAME
  GutenPosh 1.0 - SharePoint drive for the Project Gutenberg catalog

SYNOPSIS
  PowerShell module to make the Project Gutenberg catalog browsable in the
  same way as you work with the local file system.

DESCRIPTION
  GutenPosh consists of a PowerShell drive provider for the Project Gutenberg
  catalog and a set of cmdlets performing related tasks. The provider offers
  the Gutenberg drive supporting navigation among the books from the catalog
  using their meta-data for searching and browsing criteria. Reading of both
  the meta-data and content of the books is supported. The drive uses locally
  cached copy of the catalog and the book content is retrieved on-demand
  from the project web site.

REQUIREMENTS
  This module runs on PowerShell 2.0 at least. PowerShell 3.0 is recommended
  because it fixes tab-completion problems. Minimum version of the Microsoft
  .NET Framework is 3.5.

INSTALLATION
  Building the project will produce a folder GutenPosh in bin/Debug or
  bin/Release according to your configuration selection. Copy this folder
  either to %USERPROFILE%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\ or to
  %WINDIR%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules\ depending on if you want
  to use the module privately or share it with other users on your machine.
  If you copy the folder to other path make sure that it is included in the
  environment variable PSModulePath.

USAGE
  Load the GutenPosh module in your PowerShell console by the command
  Import-Module GutenPosh. List the available cmdlets by the command

  provider for the Project Gutenberg by the command Get-Help GutenPosh.
